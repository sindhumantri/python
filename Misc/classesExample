"""Comeup with a class or a datastructure in python to hold n person records where each person record comprises of the following info:
person id (e.g., 1,2,3, etc)
person name (e.g., John Doe, Mary Jane etc)
Ability to hold properties:
Favorite color for the life time of the person at the granularity of an year (e.g., 21 years of age - red, 22 years of age, blue, etc). Can assume that we need to track these details upto 100 years of age.
Salary for the life time of the person at the granularity of an year (e.g., 21 years of age - 50K, 22 years of age - 100K etc). Can assume that we need to track these details upto 100 years of age.
Implement the following method:
getProperty(property=salary or fav, color, person Id, start year, end year) that returns a list of all values for the property between start and end years (both included).
Keep the implementation generic enough that adding new properties should be easy."""

import random
class getProperty:
	
	colors = ["red", "blue", "orange", "green", "yellow", "purple"]
	salary = [10000, 20000, 4000, 60000, 50000, 800000, 12000]
	def __init__(self, person_id, start_year,end_year):
		self.person_id = person_id
		self.start_year = start_year
		self.end_year = end_year
	
	def getColor(self, property="colors"):
		for i in range(self.start_year, self.end_year):
			print( random.choice(self.colors))
	
	def getSalary(self, property="salary"):
		for i in range(self.start_year, self.end_year):
			print(random.choice(self.salary))
	
personA = getProperty("sindhu", 24, 27)
personA.getColor()
personA.getSalary()
